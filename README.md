# Shoppy Purchase Bot
## _Version 1.0_

A bot that purchases a product as soon as it is in stock.
This program waits for a specified product on a shoppy.gg store to be purchaseable and automatically buys it.
The bot is in it's initial release so there may be bugs and limited features.

## Features

Current features include:

- Card purchasing
- Easy configuration
- Easy installation
- Somewhat reliable (Bugs may appear as this is the initial release)
- Checking whether a purchase is successful or not

More features will be added as I continue to work on this project, a small list of features I plan to add are:

- [ ] More purchase methods
- [ ] Faster way of checking product stock
- [ ] A toggleable console-only version

## Usage

To run this program, you have to have Python, if you do not have it, download it from [here](https://python.org/downloads/).
Once you have Python, you need to install the needed modules, run the 'install.bat' file or in your console/terminal, type:
```sh
pip install selenium
pip install colorama
```
Once you have installed the needed modules, you need to configure the program, edit the 'config.json' file and replace the values. After this is done, you are set to run the program! Run the 'start.bat' file or type into your console/terminal:
```sh
cd src
python main.py
```
**OR**
```sh
python src/main.py
```

Once started, let the program run, and it will do its job!
If any errors occur when using the bot, please create an issue and i'll get on it as soon as I can.
